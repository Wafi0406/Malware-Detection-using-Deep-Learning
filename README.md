# Malware-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Malware Detection is a significant part of endpoint security including workstations, servers, cloud instances, and mobile devices. Malware Detection is used to detect and identify malicious activities caused by malware. With the increase in the variety of malware activities on different files online and offline,  Important for Data Security, Privacy and protection. So We will use Machine Learning especially Deep Learning and its algorithm to see the accuracy and prediction on Malware Datasets. In this Project we will use many different algorithms for analysing and studying the Malware in Dataset.
